    <p>Meatloaf is ground meat made with other ingredients, formed into a loaf shape then cooked. There is two ways to form the loaf shape, the ways are either using a loaf pan of shaped by hand.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>For Meatloaf</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>1 cup of milk</li>
      <li>6 bread slices</li>
      <li>2 pounds of ground beef</li>
      <li>1 cup of grated Parmesan</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
      <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon seasoned salt, such as Lawry's</li>
      <li>1/4 to 1/2 cup minced flat-leaf parsley</li>
      <li>4 eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>8 to 12 thin bacon slices</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Tomato Sauce</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup ketchup</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dry mustard</li>
      <li>Dash or 2 hot sauce (more if you like)</li>
      <li>Dash or 2 Worcestershire sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>For the meatloaf: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
      <li>Pour the milk over the bread and allow it to soak in for several minutes. Place the ground beef, milk-soaked bread, Parmesan, salt, some pepper, seasoned salt and parsley in a large mixing bowl. Pour in the eggs. With clean hands, mix the ingredients until well combined.</li>
      <li>Form the mixture into a loaf shape on a foil-lined broiler pan, which will allow the fat from the meat to drain.</li>
      <li>Lay the bacon slices over the top, tucking them underneath the meatloaf to give the meatloaf some support.</li>
      <li>Next, make the tomato sauce: Pour the ketchup into a bowl. Add the brown sugar and dry mustard, and splash in the hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce. Stir the mixture until well combined. Pour one-third of the sauce over the top of the meatloaf.</li>
      <li>Bake for 45 minutes, and then pour over another one-third of the remaining tomato sauce over the meatloaf. Bake for an additional 20 to 25 minutes; the meatloaf should be no longer pink in the middle. Allow to sit 10 minutes before serving.</li>
      <li>Serve with the remaining tomato sauce on the side as a dipping sauce.</li>
    </ol>
